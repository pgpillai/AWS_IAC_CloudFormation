# AWS_IAC_CloudFormation

This project is to deploy a high available web application using CloudFormation to demonstrate the skill to confidently talk about infrastructure as code. So, for that reason, we have chosen a realistic scenario where you deploy an application (Apache Web Server) and you also pick up code (JavaScript and HTML) from S3 Storage and deploy it in the appropriate folder on the web server.
